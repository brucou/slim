- the gain that we see when writing a machine by hand is because when doing so we use things about the actions/guards that we know but the computer cannot know. For instance, that the action never outputs anything, or never updates state or else.

- also NTH save the transition read from graphml into a JS array so it can be tested in the browser in case we are not so sure about the output from the compiler and want to double check.

- clean code (cruft from yed2Kingly there) but that is fairly low priority
